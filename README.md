# MaithiliNMT: An Open-Source Neural Machine Translation Framework for the Maithili Language

## Description
MaithiliNMT aims to bridge the digital language divide by providing a robust, open-source Neural Machine Translation (NMT) framework specifically for the Maithili language, spoken by millions in India and Nepal. This project leverages the latest advancements in NMT and unsupervised learning to create high-quality translation models that require minimal bilingual data, focusing on enhancing digital accessibility and preserving the linguistic heritage of the Maithili-speaking community.

## Features
- **Unsupervised Learning Approach**: Utilizes cutting-edge unsupervised learning techniques to train models with limited parallel corpora.
- **Lexical Data Augmentation**: Incorporates bilingual lexicons to improve translation accuracy, especially for low-resource languages.
- **Community-Sourced Data**: Leverages data collected and validated by the Maithili-speaking community to ensure relevance and accuracy.
- **Open-Source**: Encourages collaboration and further development within the open-source community.
